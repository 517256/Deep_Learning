Introduction:
The dataset is about online hotel reservations and contains the different attributes of customers' 
reservation details so we can predict if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel 
it.
Online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and 
customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called off due to 
cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, 
scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or 
preferably at a low cost, which is beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly 
revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.
A model predicting hotel reservation cancellations would be valuable to hotel managers and 
revenue managers. By forecasting cancellations, they could optimize inventory management, 
adjust pricing strategies, offer targeted promotions to fill expected vacancies, and manage 
overbooking to maximize occupancy and revenue. Additionally, understanding patterns in 
cancellations could help them tailor their cancellation policies to mitigate losses.
